\title{Summary of Ocean0-2\_COM\_MOM6 Results}

\section{Model Details}

\begin{itemize}
\item Model and version: Modular Ocean Model v. 6 (MOM6).
\item Repository: https://github.com/gustavo-marques/MOM6/releases/tag/ISOMIP.v1.0 
\item Model configuration and input files: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/tree/master/setup/Ocean0/COM
   \item https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/tree/master/setup/Ocean1/COM
   \item https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/tree/master/setup/Ocean2/COM
\end{itemize}

\item Vertical coordinate: layered isopycnal (density) coordinate with a bulk mixed layer scheme.
\item Horizontal mixing: harmonic (del2); along-isopycnal for diffusivities and along-layer for viscosity.
\item Vertical mixing: del2 with COM constant viscosity and diffusivity set as background values. Additional vertical mixing is also applied based on the parameterization developed by \cite{Jackson2008}, more details below. Within the mixed layer, vertical mixing is also controlled by the bulk mixed layer scheme described in \cite{Hallberg2003}.
\item Advection schemes: momentum - second-order centered; tracers - piecewise linear method.
\item Equation of state: linear with ISOMIP+ coefficients.
\item Convection parameterization: based on the parameterization developed by \cite{Jackson2008} using a critical Richardson number of $Ri_c$ = 0.25.

\item Bulk mixed layer: minimum thickness of 10 m and the minimum vertical viscosity of $10^{-2}$ m$^2$/s.

\item Melt parameterization: $T_w$, $S_w$ and $u_w$ were averaged within 10 m of the ice draft; $u_w$ was averaged the to the tracer grid using four horizontal neighbors. Melting was set to zero in regions where the ice depth was less than 90 m and when the total water column thickness was less than 10 m.

\item Modifications to Topography: Interpolated to 2-km grid using a spline method\footnote{http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp2d.html\#scipy.interpolate.interp2d} then smoothed the ice thickness using a Gaussian filter\footnote{http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.1/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.filters.gaussian\_filter.html} with half-width of 1 and 5 km for the y and x direction, respectively. An offline calving criterion was used where ice thinner than 100 m was removed. To minimize pressure gradient errors due to a step-like ice cliff, this criterion was not applied near the ice front, which remained smooth. A minimum thickness of $\sim$ 40 m was maintained by decreasing the ice thickness near the grounding line.  

\item Maintaining sea level: mass fluxes were used and no corrections were applied to maintain the sea level unchanged.  

\item Deviations from COM: the model deviated from the COM vertical mixing and convection parameterization. Instead of prescribing the COM vertical viscosity/diffusivity when the local stratification was unstable, we applied the parameterization developed by \cite{Jackson2008} using a critical Richardson number of $Ri_c$ = 0.25. Within the mixed layer, vertical mixing is also controlled by the bulk mixed layer scheme described in \cite{Hallberg2003}.

\item Parameter values:

\begin{tabular}{rl}
$\Gamma_T$ & $0.1423$ \\
$\Gamma_S$ & $4.743 \times 10^{-3}$ \\
$C_{D,\textrm{top}}$ & $2.5 \times 10^{-3}$
\end{tabular}
\end{itemize}

Based on these results, the value of $\Gamma_T$ $\sim$ 0.087 (blue star), corresponding to a mean melt rate $m_w$ $\sim$ 30 m a$^{-1}$, was used in Ocean1 and Ocean2.}
