\title{Summary of Ocean0-2\_COM\_MOM6 Results (sigma\_zstar)}

\section{Model Details}

\begin{itemize}
\item Model and version: Modular Ocean Model v. 6 (MOM6).
\item Repository: https://github.com/gustavo-marques/MOM6/releases/tag/ISOMIP.v2.1
\item Model configuration and input files:
\begin{itemize}
   \item https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/tree/master/setup/Ocean0/COM
   \item https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/tree/master/setup/Ocean1/COM
   \item https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/tree/master/setup/Ocean2/COM
   \item Note: for the sigma\_zstar experiments MOM\_override.sigma\_zstar must be used.
\end{itemize}
\item Vertical coordinate: following \cite{Stern2017}, we employ a coordinate system that is a hybrid between a z$^*$ and a terrain-following coordinate. Outside the ice shelf cavity, the vertical coordinate is defined by the $z^*$ formulation proposed by \cite{Adcroft2004}. However, within the cavity, model layers deform following the base of the ice shelf, as they would in a terrain-following coordinate, but with the fact that layers collapse to zero once they intersect the bottom topography, as in a $z^*$.
\item Horizontal mixing: harmonic (del2); along-isopycnal for diffusivities and along-layer for viscosity.
\item Vertical mixing: del2 with COM constant viscosity and diffusivity set as background values. Additional vertical mixing is also applied based on the parameterization developed by \cite{Jackson2008}, more details below. Within the mixed layer, vertical mixing is also controlled by the ocean boundary layer scheme described in \cite{Reichl2018}.
\item Remapping scheme: piecewise parabolic method (3rd-order accurate)
\item Advection schemes: momentum - second-order centered; tracers - piecewise linear method.
\item Equation of state: linear with ISOMIP+ coefficients.
\item Convection parameterization: based on the parameterization developed by \cite{Jackson2008} using a critical Richardson number of $Ri_c$ = 0.25.

\item Ocean boundary layer scheme: near-surface vertical mixing is parameterized with an energy consistent planetary boundary layer scheme \citep{Reichl2018}, with a minimum vertical viscosity of $10^{-2}$ m$^2$/s.

\item Melt parameterization: $T_w$, $S_w$ and $u_w$ were averaged within 20 m of the ice draft; $u_w$ was averaged the to the tracer grid using four horizontal neighbors. Melting was set to zero in regions where the ice depth was less than 90 m and when the total water column thickness was less than 10 m.

\item Modifications to Topography: Interpolated to 2-km grid using a spline method\footnote{http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp2d.html\#scipy.interpolate.interp2d} then smoothed the ice thickness using a Gaussian filter\footnote{http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.1/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.filters.gaussian\_filter.html} with half-width of 2 km for the y and x direction. An offline calving criterion was used where ice thinner than 100 m was removed.

\item Maintaining sea level: mass fluxes were used and sea level was keep approximately constant by removing/adding mass via a balancing flux applied in the restoring region (via virtual precipitation). Additional salt/heat fluxes were also applied so that the resultant surface buoyancy forcing is $\sim$ 0.

\item Deviations from COM: the model deviated from the COM vertical mixing and convection parameterization. Instead of prescribing the COM vertical viscosity/diffusivity when the local stratification was unstable, we applied the parameterization developed by \cite{Jackson2008} using a critical Richardson number of $Ri_c$ = 0.25. Within the top boundary layer, vertical mixing is also controlled by the ocean boundary layer scheme described in \cite{Reichl2018}.

\item Parameter values:

\begin{tabular}{rl}
$\Gamma_T$ & $0.045$ \\
$\Gamma_S$ & $0.045/35.$ \\
$C_{D,\textrm{top}}$ & $2.5 \times 10^{-3}$
\end{tabular}
\end{itemize}

Based on these results, the value of $\Gamma_T$ $\sim$ 0.045 (blue star), corresponding to a mean melt rate $m_w$ $\sim$ 30 m a$^{-1}$, was used in Ocean1 and Ocean2.}
